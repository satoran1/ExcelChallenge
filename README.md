KICKSTART MY CHART HOMEWORK #1

THE PROJECT 
This project used crowfunding service, Kickstarter project data, to  organize and analyze the database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

THE CHALLENGE  
I was able to use Excel table (Starterbook) to modify and analyze the data for the following: 
* Use conditional formatting in the `state` column with color diffentials depending on associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live. 
 * Created `Percent Funded` column using a formula to determine amount of money a campaign made to reach its initial goal using conditional formatting with three-color scale  0 (start-dark red) transitioning to  (green) at 100, and (blue) at 200. 

   * Created `Average Donation` column that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.

  * Created two new columns, one called `Category` at Q and another called `Sub-Category` at R, which use formulas to split the `Category and Sub-Category` column into two parts.

 *  Created a new sheet with a pivot table analyzing the initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per **category**.

  * Created stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table created.

  * Created a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzed the initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per **sub-category**.
  
  * Created a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the table you have created.

  * Created a new column named `Date Created Conversion` to convert the data contained within `launched_at` into Excel's date format.

  * Created a new column named `Date Ended Conversion` that converted the data contained within `deadline` into Excel's date format.

  * Created a new sheet with a pivot table with a column of `state`, rows of `Date Created Conversion`, values based on the count of `state`, and filtered based on `parent category` and `Years`.

  * Created a pivot chart line graph that visualizes the new table.
  
CONCLUSIONS 
* Created a report in Microsoft Word and answer the following questions:
1. Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
2. What are some limitations of this dataset?
3. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could
